# Instagram-Follow-Back-Checker-
This script helps you identify users you follow on Instagram who do not follow you back. It uses the `instagrapi` library to access Instagram's private API.
If used for accounts with over 500 followers/following, I recommend commenting out print statements except from the not_followbk() function
